The program enters an infinite loop because in order
for the stopping condition to ever be true, there must
exist some integer, k, s.t. dividend - k * divisor < 0,
so for dividend = 10 > 0 and divisor = 0, there is obviosly
no such k, therefore no matter how many times the program
subtracts the divisor from the dividend, we will never reach
the terminating criteria.
